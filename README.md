## Introduction

The Naive Bayes classifier is a simple yet powerful algorithm widely used in machine learning. It's particularly useful for text classification tasks due to its effectiveness in handling high-dimensional data and its ability to work well with limited amounts of training data.

This repository provides a Python implementation of the Naive Bayes classifier using the scikit-learn library. You can use it to build, train, and evaluate your own classifiers for various applications.

## Installation

To get started, you'll need to have Python and scikit-learn installed on your system. You can install scikit-learn using pip:

```bash
pip install scikit-learn
